    <p id="project-description">
      I decided to make this project in response to feeling like my words lacked impact when my friends were going through times of difficulty in their lives. I feel that my friends and I are in an age group often defined by defiance, which makes it difficult to offer advice to a friend and have them actually take it. But we all still go to each other for support and help. So I figured Alexa could help out in the meantime, and provide the answers I would have given to  common questions I hear my friends/peers ask.
