        A response to defiance
      </h1>
      <p>
        I decided to make this project after feeling my words lacked impact when my friends were going through times of difficulty in their lives and sought advice. I feel that my friends and I are in an age group often identified by defiance, which makes it difficult to offer advice to a friend and have them actually take it. Yet we all still go to each other for support and help. So I figured Alexa could help out in the meantime, and provide the answers I would have given to common questions I hear my friends/peers ask.
